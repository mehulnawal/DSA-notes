## 🎯 Problem Summary (In My Words)
> Given a non-empty array where every elemnet appears twice except one 
> Return that Single one 
---

## 🔍 Key Observations
- Non-empty array 
- Every element twice 
- Only One element appears once
- 

---

## 🚫 Brute Force Approach
**Idea:** Using nested loops
**Time Complexity:** O(n ^ 2)
**Space Complexity:** O(1) 
**Why Not Optimal:**  Because we are using the TC of n ^ 2

---

## ✅ Better Approach
**Core Idea:**  Using hashing
**Why It Works:** as every element twice and only one element appears once - so we can store them in hash and return the element which will have the value of 1 
**Data Structures Used:**  Vector 
**Why Not Optimal:** Becase in this still we are using extra space - O(n)

### 🪜 Step-by-Step Logic
1. Initalize - vector<int> nums2(n, 0)
2. Then Loop from o to n - 1 and store the frequency of all values of nums in nums2
3. After that again start a loop from 0 to n - 1 and check nums2[i] == 1 if yes then return that value index

## ⏱ Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity:** O(n ^ 2)
- **Space Complexity:** O(n)

---


## ✅ Optimized Approach
**Core Idea:**  Using Xor method 
**Why It Works:** since all the elements except one appears twice so we can do xor and find the single element 
**Data Structures Used:**  

### 🪜 Step-by-Step Logic
1. Initalize Xorr = 0
2. Then Loop from o to n - 1  and calculate the xor of all values 
3. At last return the xorr

## ⏱ Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)

## ⚠️ Mistakes I Made
- Forget to mention edge case

---

## 🧪 Edge Cases
- if size of nums is 1 then return the value of nums[0]

---

## 🧩 Pattern Tag
`#Array` `#Xor`
